// VBO OpenGL extention support switcher (if defined - game will detect and use VBO) Game could crash
// in FreeBSD under VirtualBox if vbo are used. Added just in case, if hardware capabilities detection fail.
// Looks like only virtualized systems could have this issue.
#define vbo

// VAO OpenGL extention support switcher (if defined - game will detect and use VAO), VAO will not work without VBO
// Intel video cards might have a problem with VAO (index buffer issue in intel video drivers)

// FBO OpenGL extention support switcher (if defined - game will detect and use FBO)
// Note, this will also take affect on anti aliasing support.

//#define xinerama

// joystick support, required SDL compilled with "joystick" flag

// compression during gamedata.vfs creation, game will take more time for loading in exchange of size reducing (about 30 MB)

// Since game use content released under different licenses (GPL v3, OFL v1.1, CC BY-SA v3.0),
